This project implemented Multi-Paxos to achieve a total order broadcast scheme for up to nine game players. Each player runs its own instance of the Paxos class, which handles the main algorithm logic between the Proposer, Acceptor, and Learner classes. We handle concurrency in this system, ensuring that even if two processes (players) try to send move requests at the same time, the moves are delivered in a constant order among all players in the system.
